# Holochess
Holochess - HoloVice

Babylon js project (3D) with Vice (special sort of dice). 

There is also a mode, with altered pawns, that resembles Dejarik (Star Wars Universe). 
To play this mode, you must toggle "space chess".

3D-chess (Star Trek inspired) and Omni Tama (Onitama inspired) added.

There are three basic options; versus ai, pass&play and bot match. 
Most game modes come with a print & play document (open help after game launch).


Wat needs to be improved/added;

-Multiplayer (humans online)

-AI is really random.

-Save, load a game (json format suggested).

-Last position log (for example in the chatfield).

-lay-out more friendly for all screens (inc. zoom function).


Feel free to make a fork. Spread the word and share this game! Play versus the ai or on a tablet with other board game enthusiasts.

Important: Vice/Vobbels (concept, images) are a registered property of Jonathan F.M. Neels. 
For commercial uses contact me (for non-profit causes, please download and have fun). 

Important 2: 
I have nothing to do with Star Wars (Disney), Star Trek (ViacomCBS
) or Onitama (conception). 
These are fan-based modes, without any means to gain profit (and enough different to be unique).
